# JavaBot_TNG_03

An IRC bot originally written in Java 1.4. Now updated to Java 14.

It runs on IRCNet but not on many other networks yet.
It needs to be made to run on other networks and updated with changes to IRC since it was originally written.
Also, the coding needs to be updated in places to take advantage of Java's new features.

It needs some external JARs which may also need updating, but which I can supply if you are interested in helping out.

I rewrote huge chunks of cpde in a bid to bring it up to date, and broke it, so lots of debugging going on now.

TODO: Fix the message handling code and add more logging lines so I can see whats coming back from the server.

TODO: Add logging tp jServer so I can see what it's sending and receiving in raw format.

TODO: More debugging.

TODO: More rewriting old code.
