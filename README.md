# JavaBot_TNG_03

An IRC bot originally written in Java 1.4. Now updated to Java 14.

It runs on IRCNet but not on many other networks yet.
It needs to be made to run on other networks and updated with changes to IRC since it was originally written.
Also, the coding needs to be updated in places to take advantage of Java's new features.

It needs some external JARs which may also need updating, but which I can supply if you are interested in helping out.

For TODO's check out issues.
