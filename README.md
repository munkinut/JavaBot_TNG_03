# JavaBot-TNG
An IRC bot written in Java 1.4. Needs to be updated to Java 7,8,9.

I wrote this some years ago now in an older version of Java. I'd like it brought up to date with a more modern version of Java,
and also to reflect changes in the way IRC has evolved.

It needs some external JARs which may also need updating, but which I can supply if you are interested in helping out.
